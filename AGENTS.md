## Rules

### Project Status

The project is currently in development and has not been launched yet. Necessary breaking changes are allowed, and backward compatibility with historical behavior is not required.

### Requirement-Driven Architecture

The current service architecture is designed to satisfy the current requirements and must not be treated as a permanent constraint. Future requirements may expose limitations in the existing architecture or make those requirements inconvenient to implement. When that happens:

- Prioritize satisfying the requirements over preserving the existing architecture.
- Freely perform breaking refactors or replace existing component boundaries, data flows, and technology choices when needed to provide a clear and effective implementation.
- Introduce additional infrastructure or technology stacks, including Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, or other appropriate systems, whenever the requirements justify them.
- Do not treat the current architecture or technology stack as immutable.

### Test Data and API Keys

This repository is in development. All data in this repository is test data, and any API keys are keys used for testing only. Do not redact, mask, obfuscate, or otherwise desensitize these values.

### No Historical Compatibility

Do not preserve historical compatibility. When implementing changes:

- Do not add migration paths, feature flags, dual code paths, or shims solely to keep old behavior working.
- Do not retain deprecated APIs, fields, or data formats unless they are still actively used in the current design.
- Prefer direct replacement and cleanup over gradual deprecation.
- Breaking changes are acceptable when they simplify the codebase or align with the current design.

### Superpowers Development Workflow

- Use the upstream Superpowers skills in `.agents/skills/` as the development workflow for this repository. At the start of a task, read and follow [using-superpowers](.agents/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md), including its Codex platform reference, then use the applicable skills.
- Follow Superpowers for brainstorming, design approval, planning, implementation, debugging, code review, and completion. Apply the user's current request and existing authorization; do not ask again for an unchanged decision already made in the task.
- Follow [test-driven-development](.agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md) for behavior changes and [verification-before-completion](.agents/skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md) before claiming success. Relevant tests and verification are part of implementation; they do not require a separate request. Honor explicit task-specific exceptions from the user.
- Read the relevant [requirements](docs/requirements/README.md), [designs](docs/design/README.md), and actual source as project context. Preserve business decisions, unresolved questions, and scope; keep affected long-term documents consistent with the resulting implementation. Document statuses describe facts, not additional workflow gates.
- Use Superpowers' default `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` locations when its selected workflow calls for written artifacts. Project-local worktrees belong in `.worktrees/`; temporary Superpowers execution state belongs in `.superpowers/`.
- Project-specific skills supply domain knowledge and repository operations alongside Superpowers. Installation details and the skill map are in [Superpowers Development](docs/developer-guide/superpowers-development.md).

### Chinese Plans

When outlining or listing a plan (implementation steps, task breakdown, approach summary, etc.), write the plan in Chinese (简体中文).

### Plan Implementation Completion Email

After a user-confirmed plan has been fully implemented, including all required code, configuration, documentation, and verification, send exactly one completion email from the repository root before returning the final response:

```bash
make notify-task-complete \
  TASK_NOTIFICATION_SUBJECT='任务完成：<简短任务名称>' \
  TASK_NOTIFICATION_BODY='已完成：<核心成果>；验证：<验证结果>。'
```

- Do not send this notification when only the plan has been written, or when implementation is incomplete, blocked, failed, or cancelled.
- Write a short subject and body in Simplified Chinese. Do not include passwords, tokens, API keys, or any other secrets.
- Use the default `.env` notification configuration; this rule does not switch to `.env.prod`.
- Wait for the Make command to finish before returning the final response.
- If the notification still fails after the command's built-in retries, keep the implementation task complete but report the notification failure and a credential-safe error summary in the final response. Do not claim that the email was sent.

### Impeccable Integration

- Use Superpowers to guide the development process and Impeccable for UI/UX expertise under `ui/`. Read the relevant requirements, `docs/design/web-ui/` documents, and current React/CSS implementation as context.
- Reuse the design approval obtained through Superpowers. Layout diagrams and visual previews may support that design discussion without a separate repository-specific layout gate.
- Derive any Impeccable context files from the repository's requirements, designs, and approved task spec; keep those references aligned with the project facts.
- Treat automatic Impeccable hook findings as review input. Do not weaken confirmed behavior, accessibility requirements, established brand decisions, or repository-specific UI conventions merely to clear a generic detector rule.

### 本地图片路径规则

- 读取用户提供的本地图片前，必须先将路径转换为 WSL2 可用的格式。
- 禁止将原始 Windows 路径（如 `C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Temp\image.png`）直接传给 Linux 图片工具。
- 应转换为对应的 WSL 路径，例如 `/mnt/c/Users/name/AppData/Local/Temp/image.png`；必要时使用 `wslpath -u`。
- 读取前必须确认转换后的路径真实存在。
- Windows 8.3 短路径（如 `FUNDCO~1`）必要时应解析为完整用户目录名称。
- 对 Windows 临时目录中的图片，需要区分：
  - 路径格式不正确；
  - 临时文件已经被删除。
- 转换后的文件存在时，使用其绝对 WSL 路径读取。
- 文件不存在时，应告知用户临时文件可能已经过期，并请用户重新上传或附加图片。
